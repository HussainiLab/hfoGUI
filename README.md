# hfoGUI

hfoGUI was initially a Python package designed to visualize High Frequency Oscillations (HFO's), but has grown to be an all encompassing tool to visualize LFP data recorded in the Tint format (from Axona's dacqUSB).

# Python Dependencies:
- PyQt5
- Pillow
- numpy
- PyQtGraph
- scipy
- matplotlib 
- pandas
- pyfftw

# Requirements
Since it utilizes PyQt5 as the GUI framework it should be available to a wide variety of Python versions and Operating Systems. However it was only tested on Python 3.7 with Windows 10. I do recommend using the latest version of Python as it makes it easy to download some of these C++ based dependencies. 

# Project Documentation
- TLDR. No Install Windows ONLY version. Download pre-built zip file, unzip contents to folder and run hfoGUI.exe.
